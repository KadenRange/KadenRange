## Featured Projects

### [Loss-Driven Clustered Federated Learning (LDCFL)](https://github.com/KadenRange/LDCFL)
Research extension to clustered federated learning using per-class loss vectors and spherical k-means for robust client grouping under extreme heterogeneity.

### [PuzzleBot — Personalized Chess Puzzle Generator](https://github.com/KadenRange/PuzzleBot)
End-to-end deep learning system trained on 3.08M chess positions, integrating CNN/ResNet architectures with Stockfish for personalized tactical training.

### [Transformer-Based Machine Translation](https://github.com/KadenRange/Transformer)
PyTorch implementation of an encoder–decoder Transformer trained on opus_books, achieving BLEU 22.44.

## Interests

Distributed ML systems, model robustness, and practical AI deployment.
